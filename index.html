            <h2>What Are They and Why Do We Need Them?</h2>
            <p>
                The Rhetorical Situation is essentially the collection of all the miniscule pieces that create some form of discourse. It is made up of four key parts: <a href='#exigence'>Exigence</a>, <a href='#rhetor'>Rhetor</a>, <a href='#audience'>Audience</a>, and <a href='#constraints'>Constraints</a>. Discourse in this context is defined as written or spoken communication or debate. Understanding rhetorical situations is important both when you are a rhetor and in the audience. It helps you understand and create your own discourse more effectively. It also helps you understand other discourses and their purposes when you encounter them so that you can make informed conclusions about them and even contribute to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following is an example of a rhetorical situation. As you read on, the four different parts of a rhetorical situation will be made clear in the context of this situation.
            </p>
            <p class="example">
                There was a large neon hotel sign that went up by a road in a forest-recreation zone. The hotel did not have a permit for the sign, but had applied and received a "maybe." The local newspaper printed a front-page story about it. This sparked many residents of the community to debate by writing letters to the editor on whether it should be allowed or not.

            <h2 id='exigence' class="titleblock">Exigence</h2>
            <h3>What Is Exigence?</h3>
            <p>
                Exigence is the reason for discourse. To understand exigence you must ask yourself:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is this about?</li>
                <li>Why is it needed?</li>
                <li>What is this supposed to accomplish?</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p class="example">
                To find the exigence, we ask ourselves, what is this about? In basic terms, it is about a hotel sign going up, if it was illegal and what should be done about it. If you look deeper, it is also about government interference versus local freedom. Why is it needed? It is needed so that members of the community can share their opinions about whether the sign should have been erected. What is this supposed to accomplish? There are some people in this situation who are trying to get the sign taken down and some trying to keep it standing.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Do I Care?</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding the exigence of a given discourse is the key to understanding everything about the discourse. When you know what it is about, why it is needed, and what it is supposed to accomplish, you will understand the entire discourse and its parts better.  When creating or participating in a discourse, it is important to have a clear exigence so that people can understand your message and its purpose.
            </p>
            <!--Next section-->
            <h2 id='rhetor' class="titleblock">Rhetor</h2>
            <h3>Who Is The Rhetor?</h3>
            <p>
                The rhetor is the creator and curator of the discourse. The “Authorial Voice.” The one who presents the exigence and then elaborates further. The rhetor understands their rhetorical situation better than anyone. To identify the rhetor, ask yourself:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Who is creating the discourse?</li>
              <li>Are there multiple rhetors contributing to the discourse?</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p class="example">
                In the case of the hotel sign, the rhetors are anybody contributing to the discourse. This includes the members of the community, the local newspaper, the hotel owners and even the government officials. All are making a case in the discourse.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Do I Care?</h3>
            <p>
                When you take on the role of rhetor, your job is to carefully examine all parts of the rhetorical situation. When that’s done, your discourse is significantly more likely to have an impact. When you identify the rhetor(s) of a discourse, you can use that information to understand the exigence better.
            </p>
            <!--Next section-->
            <h2 id='audience' class="titleblock">Audience</h2>
            <h3>Who Is The Audience?</h3>
            <p>
                The people for whom the discourse is intended. These are the people that the Rhetor has in mind during the entire process of creating the discourse. To identify the audience, answer these questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Who was this piece intended for?</li>
              <li>What pronouns are used during the discourse?</li>
              <li>Is there an audience that is not being addressed but may be present?</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p class="example">
                In the debate over the hotel sign, the audience is made up of many groups. The intended audience of the people writing letters to the editor are the people that they disagree with but even more broadly, the people that are members of the community and anyone who reads the letters. In this case, the audience is mostly made up of the rhetors in the situation.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Do I Care?</h3>
            <p>
                Knowing who you’re talking to with your discourse is the best way to keep yourself on track. It also allows you to include or withhold certain information depending on what your intended audience likely already knows. Sometimes you are the audience for a discourse, like in this piece. By identifying the audience, you can better understand the exigence for the discourse.
            </p>
            <!--Next section-->
            <h2 id='constraints' class="titleblock">Constraints</h2>
            <h3>What Are Constraints?</h3>
            <p>
                Constraints are very broad and can be so many things. They are pretty much anything that isn’t specifically the Rhetor or Audience that affects the discourse. Constraints can be positive or negative and affect the rhetor’s ability to achieve objectives in a discourse.
            </p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p class="example">
                When it comes to constraints in the hotel sign debate, there are some obvious ones. When writing to a newspaper, you have to stay concise. Letter writers could not speak face to face so were limited by how much they could say. A positive constraint for supporters of the sign was the fact that another town had put up a very similar sign. However, a negative constraint to the same rhetors was that the other sign had the correct legal permits.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Do I Care?</h3>
            <p>
                Constraints are important to identify. You could be constrained by the knowledge of your audience on your topic. You want to help them understand your message without confusing them. A positive constraint can help you move the audience towards your position. Identifying constraints of a discourse can help give you a better idea of who the rhetor is and what how they created the discourse.
            </p>
            <h3 class="titleblock">How Does It Help You?</h3>
            <p>
                Rhetorical Situations consist of the four parts, exigence, rhetor, audience, and constraints and they all can relate to each other. For example, convincing the audience of something can be the purpose which is part of the exigence. They all connect and are very important in a discourse. They help you, the rhetor, the audience, or the onlooker, analyze a discourse from a variety of perspectives. Understanding these situations helps you choose rhetorical strategies and stances, and understand your roles in the situation.
